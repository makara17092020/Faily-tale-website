            Once upon a time, an old mother pig had three piglets.
            Unfortunately, she didn’t have enough food to keep them, so she sent
            them out to seek their own luck. When the first pig went out, he met
            a man with a bundle of straw. The pig said, “Sir, please give me the
            straw so I can build a house.” The man gave him the straw, and the
            pig built a house out of straw.

            Soon after, a big bad wolf passed by. He knocked on the door and
            said, “Hey, little pig, let me in.” The pig replied, “No, no, not by
            the hair on my chinny chin chin.” “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and
            I’ll blow your house in,” said the wolf. And so he did. He huffed
            and he puffed, and he blew the door down. The little pig quickly ran
            away to his brother. His brother, the second pig, had met a man with
            a bundle of sticks. The pig said, “Sir, please give me the sticks so
            I can build a house.” The man gave him the sticks, and the pig built
            a house out of sticks. He was sitting in his house feeling proud
            when he heard a knock on the door. It was his little brother. “The
            wolf blew my house down! Please can I stay here?”. “Of course, my
            house is made of sticks, it’s safe for sure!” his brother said. Then
            the big bad wolf came by the house made of sticks and said, “Hey,
            little pig, let me in.” “No, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin
            chin,” replied the pig. “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow
            your house in,” said the wolf. And so he did. He huffed and he
            puffed, and he blew the door down. The two pigs quickly ran away to
            their other brother.

            The third pig had met a man with a load of bricks. The pig said,
            “Please, sir, give me those bricks so I can build a house.” The man
            gave him the bricks, and the pig built a house out of bricks. He was
            sitting in his house when he heard a knock on the door. It were his
            brothers! “The wolf has blown our houses down! Please can we stay
            here?”

            “Of course, my house is made of brick, it’s safe for sure!” the
            brother said. “But the wolf will surely come around here. Let’s make
            a plan to make sure he never bothers us again.” So the three little
            pigs came up with a plan. And just like the pig predicted, the wolf
            came to his house… The big bad wolf came to the house made of bricks
            and said, “Hey, little pig, let me in.” “No, no, not by the hair on
            my chinny chin chin,” replied the pig. “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff
            and I’ll blow your house in,” said the wolf. So the wolf huffed and
            he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed,
            but he couldn’t blow the door down. He soon realized he couldn’t
            open the door by huffing and puffing. Then, of course, the wolf
            became angry and decided that he would come after the pigs through
            the chimney. But the three little pigs knew what he was planning to
            do and they had hung a water kettle over the fire. And just as the
            wolf came down the chimney, he took the lid off the kettle. The hot
            steam reached the big bad wolf and with a big howl the wolf shot up!
            “Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh you pigs! I will get you some day!” and the
            wolf ran away as fast as he could. And after that? The big bad wolf
            never came back again, he was too scared of the three smart little
            pigs. And the pigs? They lived happily ever after, together in the
            house made of bricks.
